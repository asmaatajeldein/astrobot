# AstroBot ðŸ‘¾

This is my final project for Harvard's CS50x 2021

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/CD3tueGtBas

This is a Discord bot built for every space enthusiast and for every space-themed discord server out there! You can use it to keep track of the upcoming launches and learn more about them, know who is currently in space and learn what is the phase of the moon right now!

This bot is completely written using Python and and a bunch of REST APIs to fetch information:

- [Launch Library](https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/swagger)
- [Moon Phases API](https://www.farmsense.net/api/astro-widgets/)
